Introduction:
 During this research, a study will be conducted on electronic commerce, better known as the buying and selling of goods and services over the Internet. This type of exchange is very common in business and is typically carried out through platforms such as websites or online marketplaces, a concept also known as eCommerce.
Development:
 According to Amazon, electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the trading of goods and services on the Internet, allowing various individuals and companies to sell an increasingly large number of physical goods, digital goods, and services electronically. Now, opening parentheses: The trade of electronic goods is the buying and selling of goods and services on the Internet, where several individuals are allowed to sell an increasing number of physical goods, digital goods, and services electronically. (Amazon, 2025).
Basically, the way this electronic commerce process works, according to the reading provided by the professor and written by Hendershott, is that the process consists of six small phases.
1-The first is the submission of orders by participants, as they can decide whether they buy or sell.
2-The second is automatic registration, in which the system places all orders in the order book, organizing them by price, quantity, and priority.
 3-The third is automatic matching, where the system compares buy orders with sell orders, verifying whether prices are compatible and adjusting by priority.
 4-The fourth step executes the transaction and removes the executed orders from the book.
 5-The fifth step is communication and distribution of information, since once the operation is executed, the system must send notifications to the participants and update market information in real time.
6- Finally, the seller receives the transferred assets and the buyer completes the payment, thus generating settlement and clearance.
