Introduction:
 During this research, a study will be conducted on electronic commerce, better known as the buying and selling of goods and services over the Internet. This type of exchange is very common in business and is typically carried out through platforms such as websites or online marketplaces, a concept also known as eCommerce.
Development:
 According to Amazon, electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the trading of goods and services on the Internet, allowing various individuals and companies to sell an increasingly large number of physical goods, digital goods, and services electronically. Now, opening parentheses: The trade of electronic goods is the buying and selling of goods and services on the Internet, where several individuals are allowed to sell an increasing number of physical goods, digital goods, and services electronically. (Amazon, 2025).
Basically, the way this electronic commerce process works, according to the reading provided by the professor and written by Hendershott, is that the process consists of six small phases.
1-The first is the submission of orders by participants, as they can decide whether they buy or sell.
2-The second is automatic registration, in which the system places all orders in the order book, organizing them by price, quantity, and priority.
 3-The third is automatic matching, where the system compares buy orders with sell orders, verifying whether prices are compatible and adjusting by priority.
 4-The fourth step executes the transaction and removes the executed orders from the book.
 5-The fifth step is communication and distribution of information, since once the operation is executed, the system must send notifications to the participants and update market information in real time.
6- Finally, the seller receives the transferred assets and the buyer completes the payment, thus generating settlement and clearance.

Conlusion
In conclusion, implementing a continuous limit order book shows how fundamental data structure concepts particularly priority queues with strict price time ordering can be used to build automated systems that coordinate large volumes of buy and sell orders in real time. This approach mirrors the core mechanism used in modern stock exchanges: efficiently organizing, matching, and executing orders while maintaining fairness and transparency. The project makes it clear that the behavior of financial markets is not magic; it is the result of deterministic algorithms relying on disciplined data management and precise matching rules.

What I truly take away from this is that data structures aren’t abstract theory; they’re the engine that makes complex systems work at scale. Seeing how mechanisms like priority queues, order books, and matching algorithms organize and process information in real time made it obvious that performance and efficiency don’t come from “good coding,” but from choosing the right structure. Their impact goes far beyond software development: the same ideas power entire industries such as e commerce, financial markets, logistics, and any system where thousands of decisions need to be coordinated fairly and efficiently. Understanding this shifts the perspective: every complex problem is ultimately a problem of how you represent, order, and manage data. And once you master those foundations, you can design solutions that actually scale and solve real world challenges.

After everything we worked on—both the readings and the code development—it became clear to me that e-commerce, although not a very common topic within the field of engineering, represents a huge, competitive, and constantly growing market. It is surprising how nowadays almost everything is done through browsers, websites, and networks, making these kinds of platforms increasingly relevant. During the project, we managed to implement an e-commerce system in C++, working with two priority queues (buyers and sellers), an Order class, and an order book responsible for managing all the operations and methods needed to automatically match bids and asks. Although the logical part took time to ensure everything worked correctly, the programming process itself wasn’t too difficult. In the end, thanks to the research we did and the teamwork involved, we achieved a functional codebase that I am quite proud of—not because it is an innovation, but because it helped me better understand how a real e-commerce system is structured, processed, and automated.
